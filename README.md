# Stealthy-uRPF-Attack

IP spoofing is a widely used technique in various cyberattacks, including Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (uRPF), a standardized method for Source Address Validation (SAV), is considered a promising solution for mitigating IP-spoofing-based threats and enhancing Internet security. However, its implementation introduces vulnerabilities that adversaries can exploit.
We present SBA-uRPF, a novel stealthy BGP attack that leverages prefix hijacking to manipulate uRPFâ€™s filtering behavior, causing legitimate traffic to be inadvertently dropped and resulting in a DoS.
